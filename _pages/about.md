### Celestial Ruminations: A Quest for the Universe's Purpose

> What is the purpose of the universe? <br> 宇宙的目的是什么？

is a profound question posed in one of my favorite short stories, "朝闻道" by renowned Chinese science fiction author [Cixin Liu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Cixin). Translated into English as "Epiphany". It was this ultimate question from Liu's story that genuinely astonished me led me to explore the universe's mysteries.

I recently joined Steward Observatory (University of Arizona) as a postdoctoral researcher under the guidance of Prof. Marcia Rieke and Prof. George Rieke. Before joining Steward, I was working on intergalactic medium (IGM) and cosmic reionization with Prof. George Becker at University of California, Riverside.
You can find my CV here. My research has been focused on when and how the neutral hydrogen gas filling between galaxies became ionized around one billion years after the Big Bang using Keck, VLT, and ALMA. Currently, I am studying the evolution of galaxies at high-redshift using JWST.
