### Celestial Ruminations: A Quest for the Universe's Purpose

> What is the purpose of the universe? <br> 宇宙的目的是什么？

is a profound question posed in one of my favorite short stories, "朝闻道" by renowned Chinese science fiction author [Cixin Liu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Cixin). Translated into English as "Epiphany," this thought-provoking work has left a deep impression on me.

<!-- <font color="#75ACC0">As an astrophysics student</font> -->
As an astrophysics student, I am constantly confronted with realistic physics questions related to various tasks, such as determining the timing of reionization or modeling dark matter distribution based on the dynamics of stars. However, it was this ultimate question from Liu's story that genuinely astonished me: what is the purpose of the universe?

I can not help wondering: are we destined to remain perplexed and lost, forever seeking meaning in the vast expanse?
Perhaps no one will ever find the answer to this question, much like the most advanced civilization in the universe depicted in "Epiphany" that became perplexed and lost. Nevertheless, I embark on a lifelong journey to unravel the universe's most romantic and enigmatic riddle—a quest that transcends the stars and speaks to the essence of our existence.
