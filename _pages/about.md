# About Me
<!-- ### Celestial Ruminations: A Quest for the Universe's Purpose -->

> What is the purpose of the Universe? <br> 宇宙的目的是什么？

is a profound question raised in one of my favorite short stories, *Epiphany (朝闻道)*, by the renowned Chinese science fiction author [Cixin Liu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Cixin). Translated into English as "Epiphany". It was this ultimate question that genuinely astonished me and sparked my own journey to explore the universe's mysteries.

<!-- <font color="#75ACC0">As an astrophysics student</font> -->
I am an astrophysics Ph.D. student at Nagoya University.
My research focuses on unraveling the complex physics that drive galaxy formation and evolution across a broad range of physical scales. Specifically, I aim to address the "small-scale crises" of the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model using galactic dynamics data and explore the nature of the observed tight coupling between dark matter and ordinary matter across different types of galaxies. And I am also interested in other related research such as Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM), alternative gravitational theories, stellar streams, N-body systems, and hypervelocity stars.
