### Celestial Ruminations: A Quest for the Universe's Purpose

> What is the purpose of the universe? <br> 宇宙的目的是什么？

is a profound question posed in one of my favorite short stories, "朝闻道" by renowned Chinese science fiction author [Cixin Liu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Cixin). Translated into English as "Epiphany". It was this ultimate question from Liu's story that genuinely astonished me led me to explore the universe's mysteries.

I am an astrophysics student at Nagoya University.
My research focuses on unraveling the complex physics that drive galaxy formation and evolution across a broad range of physical scales. Specifically, I aim to address the "small-scale crises" of the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model using galactic dynamics data and explore the nature of the observed tight coupling between dark matter and ordinary matter across different types of galaxies.
